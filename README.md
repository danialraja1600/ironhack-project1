- Description
Object Oriented Programming Game called Never Give Up built using HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript. 
A simple somewhat kids game I have built in remembrance of my two late baby cousins.
This game involves around not letting the ball drop. In this game, I have
used a square. You are required to catch the square and not let it drop. This is a point and lives based game so the game can end if you fall to 0.
There are obstacles in the game in which you must either avoid or kill.

- How to play
You must catch blue square and prevent it from dropping
Move the player using left and right arrow keys
Shoot the enemies(red squares) using the space bar

You will begin the game with 5 points and 3 lives.
Catching a blue square will obtain you a point.
If you miss the blue square, you will lose a point.
If you are able to catch the blue square ten times, you will recieve
an extra life.
If you are hit by a red square, you will lose a life.
If you are able to shoot and kill a red square, you will recieve a life.

There is a yellow square, this square is a rewarding enemy.
If you are able to shoot and kill the yellow square, you will recieve
extra 3 points.

- Further Improvements
Avoid using reduntant code
Improve and implement more advanced CSS - includes images, characters,
animations
Add more sound effects. Combine them with the image effects 
    example: when enemy is killed, alongside a sound effect, a massive
    animation can show up for killing
Add levels or difficulty into the game
    example: a lot more enemies, speed of the enemies increase,
    sizes of the enemies increase or decrease(harder to shoot), enemies
    come from different angles 
Allow the user to be able to choose there character
    example: different color boxes, different characters if characters are
    implemented
